Download subreddit posts and pull specific information, like: Post title, post, author, image, image link.

You must get the app credentials from Reddit to be able to scrape their site with PRAW. Fill in the necessary fields in the script with your credentials.

ex:
        client_id="clientid",
        client_secret="clientservice",
        user_agent='appname',
        username='user',
        password='pass'

A work in progress..
